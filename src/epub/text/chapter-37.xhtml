			<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XXXVII</h2>
			<p>The little assembly which met in the vestry of Carlingford Church to inquire into the conduct of the Perpetual Curate, had so many different interests in hands when it dispersed, and so much to do, that it is difficult for the narrator of this history to decide which thread should be taken up first. Of all the interlocutors, however, perhaps <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor was the one who had least succeeded in his efforts to explain himself, and accordingly demands in the first place the attention of an impartial historian. The excellent man was still labouring under much perplexity when the bed of justice was broken up. He began to recollect that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth’s explanation on the previous night had convinced him of his innocence, and to see that it was indeed altogether inconceivable that the Curate should be guilty; but then, other matters still more disagreeable to contemplate than <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth’s guilt came in to darken the picture. This vagabond Wodehouse, whom the Curate had taken in at his sister’s request⁠—what was the meaning of that mystery? <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor had never been anyhow connected with mysteries; he was himself an only son, and had lived a straightforward peaceable life. Neither he nor his estimable parents, so far as the late Rector was aware, had ever done anything to be ashamed of; and he winced a little at the thought of connecting himself with concealment and secrecy. And then the Curate’s sudden disappearance on the previous evening perplexed and troubled him. He imagined all kinds of reasons for it as he walked down Grange Lane. Perhaps Miss Wodehouse, who would not receive himself, had sent for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth; perhaps the vagabond brother was in some other scrape, out of which he had to be extricated by the Curate’s assistance. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor was perfectly honest, and indeed determined, in his “intentions;” but everybody will allow that for a middle-aged lover of fifty or thereabouts, contemplating a sensible match with a lady of suitable years and means, to find suddenly that the object of his affections was not only a penniless woman, but the natural guardian of an equally penniless sister, was startling, to say the least of it. He was a true man, and it did not occur to him to decline the responsibility altogether; on the contrary, he was perhaps more eager than he would have been otherwise, seeing that his elderly love had far more need of his devotion than he had ever expected her to have; but, notwithstanding, he was disturbed by such an unlooked-for change of circumstances, as was natural, and did not quite know what was to be done with Lucy. He was full of thoughts on this subject as he proceeded towards the house, to the interview which, to use sentimental language, was to decide his fate. But, to tell the truth, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor was not in a state of very deep anxiety about his fate. The idea of being refused was too unreasonable an idea to gain much ground in his mind. He was going to offer his personal support, affection, and sympathy to Miss Wodehouse at the least fortunate moment in her life; and if there was anything consolatory in marriage at all, the late Rector sensibly concluded that it must be doubly comforting under such circumstances, and that the offer of an honest man’s hand and house and income was not a likely thing to be rejected by a woman of Miss Wodehouse’s experience and good sense⁠—not to speak of his heart, which was very honest and true and affectionate, though it had outlived the fervours of youth. Such was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor’s view of the matter; and the chances were strong that Miss Wodehouse entirely agreed with him⁠—so, but for a certain shyness which made him rather nervous, it would not be correct to say that the late Rector was in a state of special anxiety about the answer he was likely to receive. He was, however, anxious about Lucy. His bachelor mind was familiar with all the ordinary traditions about the inexpediency of being surrounded by a wife’s family; and he had a little of the primitive male sentiment, shared one way or other by most husbands, that the old system of buying a woman right out, and carrying her off for his own sole and private satisfaction, was, after all, the correct way of managing such matters. To be sure, a pretty, young, unmarried sister, was perhaps the least objectionable encumbrance a woman could have; but, notwithstanding, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor would have been glad could he have seen any feasible way of disposing of Lucy. It was utterly out of the question to think of her going out as a governess; and it was quite evident that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth, even were he perfectly cleared of every imputation, having himself nothing to live upon, could scarcely offer to share his poverty with poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wodehouse’s cherished pet and darling. “I daresay she has been used to live expensively,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor said to himself, wincing a little in his own mind at the thought. It was about one o’clock when he reached the green door⁠—an hour at which, during the few months of his incumbency at Carlingford, he had often presented himself at that hospitable house. Poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wodehouse! <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor could not help wondering at that moment how he was getting on in a world where, according to ordinary ideas, there are no lunch nor dinner parties, no old port nor savoury side-dishes. Somehow it was impossible to realise <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wodehouse with other surroundings than those of good-living and creature-comfort. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor sighed, half for the departed, half at thought of the strangeness of that unknown life for which he himself did not feel much more fitted than <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wodehouse. In the garden he saw the new heir sulkily marching about among the flowerbeds smoking, and looking almost as much out of place in the sweet tranquillity of the English garden, as a churchwarden of Carlingford or a Fellow of All Souls could look, to carry out <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor’s previous imagination, in the vague beatitude of a disembodied heaven. Wodehouse was so sick of his own company that he came hastily forward at the sight of a visitor, but shrank a little when he saw who it was.</p>
			<p>“I suppose you have brought some news,” he said, in his sullen way. “I suppose he has been making his statements, has he? Much I care! He may tell what lies he pleases; he can’t do me any harm. I never did anything but sign my own name, by Jove! Jack Wentworth himself says so. I don’t care <em>that</em> for the parson and his threats,” said Wodehouse, snapping his fingers in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor’s face. The late Rector drew back a little, with a shudder of disgust and resentment. He could not help thinking that this fellow would most likely be his brother-in-law presently, and the horror he felt made itself visible in his face.</p>
			<p>“I am quite unaware what you can mean,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor. “I am a parson, but I never made any threats that I know of. I wish to see Miss Wodehouse. I⁠—I think she expects me at this hour,” he said, with a little embarrassment, turning to John, who, for his part, had been standing by in a way which became his position as a respectable and faithful servant, waiting any opportunity that might come handy to show his disgust for the new regime.</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir,” said John, promptly, and with emphasis. “My mistress expects you, sir. She’s come down to the drawing-room for the first time. Miss Lucy keeps her room, sir, still; she’s dreadfully cut up, poor dear young lady. My mistress will be glad to see you, sir,” said John. This repetition of a title which Miss Wodehouse had not been in the habit of receiving was intended for the special advantage of the new master, whom John had no intention of recognising in that capacity. “If you should know of anyone, sir, as is in want of a steady servant,” the man continued, as he led the way into the house, with a shrewd glance at <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, whose “intentions” were legible enough to John’s experienced eyes⁠—“not as I’m afeared of getting suited, being well known in Carlingford; but it would come natural to be with a friend of the family. There aint a servant in the house, sir, as will stay when the ladies go, and I think as Miss Wodehouse would speak for me,” said John, with natural astuteness. This address made <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor a little uneasy. It recalled to him the unpleasant side of the important transaction in which he was about to engage. He was not rich, and did not see his way now to any near prospect of requiring the services of “a steady servant,” and the thought made him sigh.</p>
			<p>“We’ll see,” he said, with a troubled look. To persevere honourably in his “intentions” was one thing, but to be insensible to the loss of much he had looked forward to was quite another. It was accordingly with a grave and somewhat disturbed expression that he went to the interview which was “to decide his fate.” Miss Wodehouse was seated in the drawing-room, looking slightly flushed and excited. Though she knew it was very wrong to be thus roused into a new interest the day after her father’s funeral, the events altogether had been of so startling a description that the usual decorum of an afflicted household had already been ruthlessly broken. And on the whole, notwithstanding her watching and grief, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor thought he had never seen the object of his affections looking so well as she did now in the long black dress, which suited her better than the faint dove colours in which she arrayed herself by preference. She was not, it is true, quite sure what <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor wanted in this interview he had solicited, but a certain feminine instinct instructed her in its probable eventualities. So she sat in a subdued flutter, with a little colour fluctuating on her cheek, a tear in her eyes, and some wonder and expectation in her heart. Perhaps in her youth Miss Wodehouse might have come to such a feminine crisis before; but if so, it was long ago, and the gentle woman had never been given to matrimonial speculations, and was as fresh and inexperienced as any girl. The black frame in which she was set made her soft colour look fresher and less faded. Her plaintive voice, the general softness of her demeanour, looked harmonious and suitable to her circumstances. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, who had by no means fallen in love with her on account of any remnants of beauty she might possess, had never admired her so much as he did now; he felt confused, good man, as he stood before her, and, seeing her so much younger and fairer than his former idea, began to grow alarmed, and wonder at his serenity. What if she thought him an old fogey? what if she refused him? This supposition brought a crimson colour to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor’s middle-aged countenance, and was far from restoring his courage. It was a wonderful relief to him when she, with the instinct of a timid woman, rushed into hasty talk.</p>
			<p>“It was very kind of you to come yesterday,” she said; “Lucy and I were very grateful. We have not many relatives, and my dear father⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said the late Rector, again embarrassed by the tears which choked her voice, “he was very much respected: that must be a consolation to you. And he had a long life⁠—and⁠—and I suppose, on the whole, a happy one,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, “with you and your sister⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Oh, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, he had a great deal to put up with,” said Miss Wentworth, through her tears. She had, like most simple people, an instinctive disinclination to admit that anybody was or had been happy. It looked like an admission of inferiority. “Mamma’s death, and poor Tom,” said the elder sister. As she wiped her eyes, she almost forgot her own little feminine flutter of expectancy in respect to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor himself. Perhaps it was not going to happen this time, and as she was pretty well assured that it would happen one day or another, she was not anxious about it. “If I only knew what to do about Tom,” she continued, with a vague appeal in her voice.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor got up from his chair and walked to the window. When he had looked out he came back, rather surprising Miss Wodehouse by his unlooked-for movements. “I wanted very much to have a little conversation with you,” he said, growing again very red. “I daresay you will be surprised⁠—but I have accepted another living, Miss Wodehouse;” and here the good man stopped short in a terrible state of embarrassment, not knowing what next to say.</p>
			<p>“Yes?” said Miss Wodehouse, interrogatively. Her heart began to beat quicker, but perhaps he was only going to tell her about the new work he had undertaken; and then she was a woman, and had some knowledge, which came by nature, how to conduct herself on an occasion such as this.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know whether you recollect,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor⁠—“I shall never forget it⁠—one time when we all met in a house where a woman was dying⁠—I mean your sister and young Wentworth, and you and I;⁠—and neither you nor I knew anything about it,” said the late Rector, in a strange voice. It was not a complimentary way of opening his subject, and the occurrence had not made so strong an impression upon Miss Wodehouse as upon her companion. She looked a little puzzled, and, as he made a pause, gave only a murmur of something like assent, and waited to hear what more he might have to say.</p>
			<p>“We neither of us knew anything about it,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor⁠—“neither you how to manage her, nor I what to say to her, though the young people did. I have always thought of you from that time. I have thought I should like to try whether I was good for anything now⁠—if you would help me,” said the middle-aged lover. When he had said this he walked to the window, and once more looked out, and came back redder than ever. “You see we are neither of us young,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor; and he stood by the table turning over the books nervously, without looking at her, which was certainly an odd commencement for a wooing.</p>
			<p>“That is quite true,” said Miss Wodehouse, rather primly. She had never disputed that fact by word or deed, but still it was not pleasant to have the statement thus thrust upon her without any apparent provocation. It was not the sort of thing which a woman expects to have said to her under such circumstances. “I am sure I hope you will do better⁠—I mean be more comfortable⁠—this time,” she continued, after a pause, sitting very erect on her seat.</p>
			<p>“If you will help me,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, taking up one of the books and reading the name on it, which was lucky for him, for it was Miss Wodehouse’s name, which he either had forgotten or never had known.</p>
			<p>And here they came to a dead stop. What was she to say? She was a little affronted, to tell the truth, that he should remember more distinctly than anything else her age, and her unlucky failure on that one occasion. “You have just said that I could not manage,” said the mild woman, not without a little vigour of her own; “and how then could I help you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor? Lucy knows a great deal more about parish work than I do,” she went on in a lower tone; and for one half of a second there arose in the mind of the elder sister a kind of wistful half envy of Lucy, who <em>was</em> young, and knew how to manage⁠—a feeling which died in unspeakable remorse and compunction as soon as it had birth.</p>
			<p>“But Lucy would not have me,” said the late Rector; “and indeed I should not know what to do with her if she would have me;⁠—but you⁠—It is a small parish, but it’s not a bad living. I should do all I could to make you comfortable. At least we might try,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, in his most insinuating tone. “Don’t you think we might try? at least it would do⁠—” He was going to say “no harm,” but on second thoughts rejected that expression. “At least I should be very glad if you would,” said the excellent man, with renewed confusion. “It’s a nice little rectory, with a pretty garden, and all that sort of thing; and⁠—and perhaps⁠—it might help you to settle about going away⁠—and⁠—and I daresay there would be room for Lucy. Don’t you think you would try?” cried <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, volunteering, in spite of himself, the very hospitality which he had thought it hard might be required of him; but somehow his suit seemed to want backing at the actual moment when it was being made.</p>
			<p>As for Miss Wodehouse, she sat and listened to him till he began to falter, and then her composure gave way all at once. “But as for trying,” she gasped, in broken mouthfuls of speech, “that would never⁠—never do, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor. It has to be done⁠—done for good and all⁠—if⁠—if it is done at all,” sobbed the poor lady, whose voice came somewhat muffled through her handkerchief and her tears.</p>
			<p>“Then it shall be for good and all!” cried <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, with a sudden impulse of energy. This was how it came about that Miss Wodehouse and the late Rector were engaged. He had an idea that he might be expected to kiss her, and certainly ought to call her Mary after this; and hovered for another minute near her seat, not at all disinclined for the former operation. But his courage failed him, and he only drew a chair a little closer and sat down, hoping she would soon stop crying. And indeed, by the time that he produced out of his pocketbook the little photograph of the new rectory, which he had had made for her by a rural artist, Miss Wodehouse had emerged out of her handkerchief, and was perhaps in her heart as happy in a quiet way as she had ever been in her life. She who had never been good for much, was now, in the time of their need, endowed with a home which she could offer Lucy. It was she, the helpless one of the family, who was to be her young sister’s deliverer. Let it be forgiven to her if, in the tumult of the moment, this was the thought that came first.</p>
			<p>When Miss Wodehouse went upstairs after this agitating but satisfactory interview, she found Lucy engaged in putting together some books and personal trifles of her own which were scattered about the little sitting-room. She had been reading <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">In Memoriam</i> until it vexed her to feel how inevitably good sense came in and interfered with the enthusiasm of her grief, making her sensible that to apply to her fond old father all the lofty lauds which were appropriate to the poet’s hero would be folly indeed. He had been a good tender father to her, but he was not “the sweetest soul that ever looked with human eyes;” and Lucy could not but stop in her reading with a kind of pang and self-reproach as this consciousness came upon her. Miss Wodehouse looked rather aghast when she found her sister thus occupied. “Did you think of accepting Miss Wentworth’s invitation, after all?” said Miss Wodehouse; “but, dear, I am afraid it would be awkward; and oh, Lucy, my darling, I have so many things to tell you,” said the anxious sister, who was shy of communicating her own particular news. Before many minutes had passed, Lucy had thrown aside all the books, and was sitting by her sister’s side in half-pleased, disconcerted amazement to hear her story. Only half-pleased⁠—for Lucy, like most other girls of her age, thought love and marriage were things which belonged only to her own level of existence, and was a little vexed and disappointed to find that her elder sister could condescend to such youthful matters. On the whole, she rather blushed for Mary, and felt sadly as if she had come down from an imaginary pedestal. And then <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, so old and so ordinary, whom it was impossible to think of as a bridegroom, and still less as a brother. “I shall get used to it presently,” said Lucy, with a burning flush on her cheek, and a half feeling that she had reason to be ashamed; “but it is so strange to think of you in that way, Mary. I always thought you were too⁠—too sensible for that sort of thing,” which was a reproach that went to Miss Wodehouse’s heart.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Lucy, dear,” said that mild woman, who in this view of the matter became as much ashamed of herself as Lucy could desire, “what could I do? I know what you mean, at my time of life; but I could not let you be dependent on Tom, my darling,” said Miss Wodehouse, with a deprecating appealing look.</p>
			<p>“No indeed,” said Lucy; “that would be impossible under any circumstances: nor on you either, Mary dear. I can do something to make a living, and I should like it. I have always been fond of work. I will not permit you to sacrifice yourself for me,” said the younger sister, with some dignity. “I see how it has been. I felt sure it was not of your own accord.”</p>
			<p>Miss Wodehouse wrung her hands with dismay and perplexity. What was she to do if Lucy stood out and refused her consent? She could not humble herself so far as to confess that she rather liked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor, and was, on the whole, not displeased to be married; for the feeling that Lucy expected her to be too sensible for that sort of thing overawed the poor lady. “But, Lucy, I have given him my promise,” said poor Miss Wodehouse. “It⁠—it would make him very unhappy. I can’t use him badly, Lucy dear.”</p>
			<p>“I will speak to him, and explain if it is necessary. Whatever happens, I can’t let you sacrifice yourself for me,” said Lucy. All the answer Miss Wodehouse could make was expressed in the tears of vexation and mortification which rushed to her eyes. She repelled her young sister’s ministrations for the first time in her life with hasty impatience. Her troubles had not been few for the last twenty-four hours. She had been questioned about Tom till she had altogether lost her head, and scarcely knew what she was saying; and Lucy had not applauded that notable expedient of throwing the shame of the family upon <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth, to be concealed and taken care of, which had brought so many vexations to the Perpetual Curate. Miss Wodehouse at last was driven to bay. She had done all for the best, but nobody gave her any credit for it; and now this last step, by which she had meant to provide a home for Lucy, was about to be contradicted and put a stop to altogether. She put away Lucy’s arm, and rejected her consolations. “What is the use of pretending to be fond of me if I am always to be wrong, and never to have my⁠—my own way in anything?” cried the poor lady, who, beginning with steadiness, broke down before she reached the end of her little speech. The words made Lucy open her blue eyes with wonder; and after that there followed a fuller explanation, which greatly changed the ideas of the younger sister. After her “consent” had been at last extracted from her, and when Miss Wodehouse regained her composure, she reported to Lucy the greater part of the conversation which had taken place in the drawing-room, of which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor’s proposal constituted only a part, and which touched upon matters still more interesting to her hearer. The two sisters, preoccupied by their father’s illness and death, had up to this time but a vague knowledge of the difficulties which surrounded the Perpetual Curate. His trial, which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor had reported to his newly-betrothed, had been unsuspected by either of them; and they were not even aware of the event which had given rise to it⁠—the disappearance of Rosa Elsworthy. Miss Wodehouse told the story with faltering lips, not being able to divest herself of the idea that, having been publicly accused, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth must be more or less guilty; while, at the same time, a sense that her brother must have had something to do with it, and a great reluctance to name his name, complicated the narrative. She had already got into trouble with Lucy about this unlucky brother, and unconsciously, in her story, she took an air of defence. “I should have thought better of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth if he had not tried to throw the guilt on another,” said the perplexed woman. “Oh, Lucy dear, between two people it is so hard to know what to do.”</p>
			<p>“I know what I shall do,” said Lucy, promptly; but she would not further explain herself. She was, however, quite roused up out of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">In Memoriam</i>. She went to her desk and drew out some of the paper deeply edged with black, which announced before words its tale of grief to all her correspondents. It was with some alarm that Miss Wodehouse awaited this letter, which was placed before her as soon as finished. This was what, as soon as she knew the story, Lucy’s prompt and generous spirit said:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p><b epub:type="z3998:salutation">Dear <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth</b>⁠—We have just heard of the vexations you have been suffering, to our great indignation and distress. Some people may think it is a matter with which I have no business to interfere; but I cannot have you think for a moment, that we, to whom you have been so kind, could put the slightest faith in any such accusations against you. We are not of much consequence, but we are two women, to whom any such evil would be a horror. If it is anyone connected with us who has brought you into this painful position, it gives us the more reason to be indignant and angry. I know now what you meant about the will. If it was to do over again, I should do just the same; but for all that, I understand now what you meant. I understand, also, how much we owe to you, of which, up to yesterday, I was totally unaware. You ought never to have been asked to take our burden upon your shoulders. I suppose you ought not to have done it; but all the same, thank you with all my heart. I don’t suppose we ever can do anything for you to show our gratitude; and indeed I do not believe in paying back. But in the meantime, thank you⁠—and don’t, from any consideration for us, suffer a stain which belongs to another to rest upon yourself. You are a clergyman, and your reputation must be clear. Pardon me for saying so, as if I were qualified to advise you; but it would be terrible to think that you were suffering such an injury out of consideration for us.⁠—Gratefully and truly yours,</p>

			</blockquote>
			<p>The conclusion of this letter gave Lucy a good deal of trouble. Her honest heart was so moved with gratitude and admiration that she had nearly called herself “affectionately” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth’s. Why should not she? “He has acted like a brother to us,” Lucy said to herself; and then she paused to inquire whether his conduct had indeed arisen from brotherly motives solely. Then, when she had begun to write “faithfully” instead, a further difficulty occurred to her. Not thus lightly and unsolicited could she call herself “faithful,” for did not the word mean everything that words could convey in any human relationship? When she had concluded it at last, and satisfied her scruples by the formula above, she laid the letter before her sister. This event terminated the active operations of the day in the dwelling of the Wodehouses. Their brother had not asked to see them, had not interrupted them as yet in their retreat upstairs, where they were sedulously waited upon by the entire household. When Miss Wodehouse’s agitation was over, she too began to collect together her books and personalities, and they ended by a long consultation where they were to go and what they were to do, during the course of which the elder sister exhibited with a certain shy pride that little photograph of the new rectory, in which there was one window embowered in foliage, which the bride had already concluded was to be Lucy’s room. Lucy yielded during this sisterly conference to sympathetic thoughts even of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Proctor. The two women were alone in the world. They were still so near the grave and the deathbed that chance words spoken without thought from time to time awakened in both the ready tears. Now and then they each paused to consider with a sob what <em>he</em> would have liked best. They knew very little of what was going on outside at the moment when they were occupied with those simple calculations. What was to become of them, as people say⁠—what money they were to have, or means of living⁠—neither was much occupied in thinking of. They had each other; they had, besides, one a novel and timid middle-aged confidence, the other an illimitable youthful faith in one man in the world. Even Lucy, whose mind and thoughts were more individual than her sister’s, wanted little else at that moment to make her happy with a tender tremulous consolation in the midst of her grief.</p>
