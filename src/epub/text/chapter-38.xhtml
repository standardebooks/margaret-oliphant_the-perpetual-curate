			<p>While matters were thus arranging themselves in the ideas at least of the two sisters whose prospects had been so suddenly changed, explanations of a very varied kind were going on in the house of the Miss Wentworths. It was a very full house by this time, having been invaded and taken possession of by the “family” in a way which entirely obliterated the calmer interests and occupations of the habitual inhabitants. The three ladies had reached the stage of life which knows no personal events except those of illness and death; and the presence of Jack Wentworth, of Frank and Gerald, and even of Louisa, reduced them altogether to the rank of spectators, the audience, or at the utmost the chorus, of the drama; though this was scarcely the case with Miss Dora, who kept her own room, where she lay on the sofa, and received visits, and told the story of her extraordinary adventure, the only adventure of her life. The interest of the household centred chiefly, however, in the dining-room, which, as being the least habitable apartment in the house, was considered to be most adapted for anything in the shape of business. On the way from the church to Miss Wentworth’s house the Curate had given his father a brief account of all the events which had led to his present position; but though much eased in his mind, and partly satisfied, the Squire was not yet clear how it all came about. His countenance was far from having regained that composure, which indeed the recent course of events in the family had pretty nearly driven out of his life. His fresh light-coloured morning dress, with all its little niceties, and the fresh colour which even anxiety could not drive away from his cheeks, were somehow contradicted in their sentiment of cheerfulness by the puckers in his forehead and the harassed look of his face. He sat down in the big leathern chair by the fireplace, and looked round him with a sigh, and the air of a man who wonders what will be the next vexation. “I’d like to hear it over again, Frank,” said the Squire. “My mind is not what it used to be; I don’t say I ever was clever, like you young fellows, but I used to understand what was said to me. Now I seem to require to hear everything twice over; perhaps it is because I have had myself to say the same things over again a great many times lately,” he added, with a sigh of weariness. Most likely his eye fell on Gerald as he said so; at all events, the Rector of Wentworth moved sadly from where he was standing and went to the window, where he was out of his father’s range of vision. Gerald’s looks, his movements, every action of his, seemed somehow to bear a symbolic meaning at this crisis in his life. He was no longer in any doubt; he had made up his mind. He looked like a martyr walking to his execution, as he crossed the room; and the Squire looked after him, and once more breathed out of his impatient breast a heavy short sigh. Louisa, who had placed herself in the other great chair at the other side of the forlorn fireplace, from which, this summer afternoon, there came no cheerful light, put up her handkerchief to her eyes and began to cry with half-audible sobs⁠—which circumstances surrounding him were far from being encouraging to Frank as he entered anew into his own story⁠—a story which he told with many interruptions. The Squire, who had once “sworn by Frank,” had now a terrible shadow of distrust in his mind. Jack was here on the spot, of whom the unfortunate father knew more harm than he had ever told, and the secret dread that he had somehow corrupted his younger brother came like a cold shadow over <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth’s mind. He could not slur over any part of the narrative, but cross-examined his son to the extent of his ability, with an anxious inquisition into all the particulars. He was too deeply concerned to take anything for granted. He sat up in his chair with those puckers in his forehead, with that harassed look in his eyes, making an anxious, vigilant, suspicious investigation, which was pathetic to behold. If the defendant, who was thus being examined on his honour, had been guilty, the heart of the judge would have broken; but that was all the more reason for searching into it with jealous particularity, and with a suspicion which kept always gleaming out of his troubled eyes in sudden anxious glances, saying, “You are guilty? Are you guilty?” with mingled accusations and appeals. The accused, being innocent, felt this suspicion more hard to bear than if he had been a hundred times guilty.</p>
			<p>“I understand a little about this fellow Wodehouse,” said the Squire; “but what I want to know is, why you took him in? What did you take him in for, sir, at first? Perhaps I could understand the rest if you would satisfy me of that.”</p>
			<p>“I took him in,” said the Curate, rather slowly, “because his sister asked me. She threw him upon my charity⁠—she told me the danger he was in⁠—”</p>
			<p>“What danger was he in?” asked the Squire.</p>
			<p>The Curate made a pause, and as he paused <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth leaned forward in his chair, with another pucker in his forehead and a still sharper gleam of suspicion in his eyes. “His father had been offended time after time in the most serious way. This time he had threatened to give him up to justice. I can’t tell you what he had done, because it would be breaking my trust⁠—but he had made himself obnoxious to the law,” said Frank Wentworth. “To save him from the chance of being arrested, his sister brought him to me.”</p>
			<p>The Squire’s hand shook a good deal as he took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead. “Perhaps it would be the best way if one had not too much regard for the honour of the family,” he said, tremulously, like a man under a sudden temptation; “but the sister, sir, why did she bring him to you?” he added, immediately after, with renewed energy. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth was not aware that, while he was speaking, his eldest son had come into the room. He had his back to the door, and he did not see Jack, who stood rather doubtfully on the threshold, with a certain shade of embarrassment upon his ordinary composure. “It is not everybody that a woman would confide her brother’s life to,” said the Squire. “Who is the sister? Is she⁠—is there any⁠—any entanglement that I don’t know of? It will be better for all of us if you tell me plainly,” said the old man, with a querulous sound in his voice. He forgot the relationship of his own girls to Jack, and groaned within himself at what appeared almost certain evidence that the sister of a criminal like Wodehouse had got possession of Frank.</p>
			<p>“Miss Wodehouse is about the same age as my aunt Dora,” said the Curate. It was an exaggeration which would have gone to the poor lady’s heart, but Frank Wentworth, in the unconscious insolence of his youth, was quite unaware and careless of the difference. Then he paused for a moment with an involuntary smile. “But I am a clergyman, sir,” he continued, seriously. “If a man in my position is good for anything, it is his business to help the helpless. I could do no good in any other way⁠—I took him into my house.”</p>
			<p>“Frank,” said the Squire, “I beg your pardon. I believe in my heart you’re true and honest. If I were not driven out of my senses by one thing and another,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth, with bitterness. “They make me unjust to you, sir⁠—unjust to you! But never mind; go on. Why didn’t you tell these fellows what you’ve told me? That would have settled the business at once, without any more ado.”</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Morgan is a great deal too much prejudiced against me to believe anything I said. I thought it better to let him prove to himself his own injustice; and another still more powerful reason⁠—” said the Curate.</p>
			<p>“Stop, sir, stop; I can’t follow you to more than one thing at a time. Why is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Morgan prejudiced against you?” said the Squire, once more sitting upright and recommencing his examination.</p>
			<p>Frank Wentworth laughed in spite of himself, though he was far from being amused. “I know no reason, except that I have worked in his parish without his permission,” he answered, briefly enough, “for which he threatened to have me up before somebody or other⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lushington, I suppose, who is the new Council of Trent, and settles all our matters for us nowadays,” said the Curate, not without a little natural scorn, at which, however, his father groaned.</p>
			<p>“There is nothing to laugh at in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lushington,” said the Squire. “He gives you justice, at all events, which you parsons never give each other, you know. You ought not to have worked in the Rector’s parish, sir, without his permission. It’s like shooting in another man’s grounds. However, that’s not my business;⁠—and the other reason, sir?” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth, with his anxious look.</p>
			<p>“My dear father,” said the Curate, touched by the anxiety in the Squire’s face, and sitting down by him with a sudden impulse, “I have done nothing which either you or I need be ashamed of. I am grieved that you should think it necessary to examine me so closely. Wodehouse is a rascal, but I had taken charge of him; and as long as it was possible to shield him, I felt bound to do so. I made an appeal to his honour, if he had any, and to his fears, which are more to be depended on, and gave him until noon today to consider it. Here is his note, which was given me in the vestry; and now you know the whole business, and how it is that I postponed the conclusion till tonight.”</p>
			<p>The Squire put on his spectacles with a tremulous hand to read the note which his son gave him. The room was very still while he read it, no sound interrupting him except an occasional sniff from Louisa, who was in a permanent state of whimpering, and, besides, had ceased to be interested in Frank’s affairs. Jack Wentworth, standing in the background behind the Squire’s chair, had the whole party before him, and studied them keenly with thoughts which nobody guessed at. Gerald was still standing by the window, leaning on it with his face only half turned to the others. Was he thinking of the others? was he still one of them? or was he saying his office from some invisible breviary abstracted into another life? That supposition looked the most like truth. Near him was his wife, who had thrown herself, a heap of bright fluttering muslin, into the great chair, and kept her handkerchief to her red eyes. She had enough troubles of her own to occupy her, poor soul! Just at that moment it occurred to her to think of the laburnum berries in the shrubbery at the Rectory, which, it was suddenly borne in upon her, would prove fatal to one or other of the children in her absence;⁠—the dear Rectory which she had to leave so soon! “And Frank will have it, of course,” Louisa said to herself, “and marry somebody;” and then she thought of the laburnum berries in connection with his problematical children, not without a movement of satisfaction. Opposite to her was the Squire, holding Wodehouse’s epistle in a hand which shook a little, and reading aloud slowly as he could make it out. The note was short and insolent enough. While it was being read, Jack Wentworth, who was not easily discomposed, grew red and restless. He had not dictated it certainly, nor even suggested the wording of the epistle; but it was he who, half in scorn and half in pity of the vagabond’s terrors, had reassured Wodehouse, and convinced him that it was only the punishments of public opinion which the Curate could bring upon him. Hardened as Jack was, he could not but be conscious that thus to stand in his brother’s way was a shabby business enough, and to feel that he himself and his protégé cut a very poor figure in presence of the manful old Squire with all his burdens, and of Frank, who had, after all, nothing to explain which was not to his honour. Notwithstanding that he was at the present moment his brother’s adversary, actually working against him and prolonging his difficulties, an odd kind of contempt and indignation against the fools who could doubt Frank’s honour possessed the prodigal at the moment. “A parcel of asses,” he said to himself; and so stood and listened to Wodehouse’s little note of defiance, which, but for his prompting, the sullen vagabond would never have dared to send to his former protector. The letter itself was as follows:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>I have consulted my friends about what you said today, and they tell me it is d⁠⸺⁠d nonsense. You can’t do me any harm; and I don’t mean to get myself into any scrape for you. You can do what you like⁠—I shan’t take any notice. Your love affairs are no business of mine.⁠—<span epub:type="z3998:valediction">Yours truly,</span></p>
				<footer role="presentation">
					<p epub:type="z3998:sender z3998:signature"><abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Wodehouse.</p>
				</footer>
			</blockquote>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth threw the miserable scrawl on the table. “The fellow is a scoundrel,” said the Squire; “he does not seem to have a spark of gratitude. You’ve done a deal too much for him already; and if the sister is as old as Dora⁠—” he continued, after a long pause, with a half-humorous relaxation of his features. He was too much worn out to smile.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said the Curate. The young man was sensible of a sudden flush and heat, but did not feel any inclination to smile. Matters were very serious just then with Frank Wentworth. He was about to shake himself free of one vexation, no doubt; but at this moment, when Lucy Wodehouse was homeless and helpless, he had nothing to offer her, nor any prospects even which he dared ask her to share with him. This was no time to speak of the other sister, who was not as old as Miss Dora. He was more than ever the Perpetual Curate now. Perhaps, being a clergyman, he ought not to have been swayed by such merely human emotions; but honour and pride alike demanded that he should remain in Carlingford, and he had no shelter to offer Lucy in the time of her need.</p>
			<p>After this there followed a pause, which was far from being cheerful. Frank could not but be disconsolate enough over his prospects when the excitement died away; and there was another big, terrible event looming darkly in the midst of the family, which they had not courage to name to each other. The long, uneasy pause was at length broken by Louisa, whose voice sounded in the unnatural silence like the burst of impatient rain which precedes a thunderstorm.</p>
			<p>“Now that you have done with Frank’s affairs, if you have done with them,” said Louisa, “perhaps somebody will speak to Gerald. I don’t mean in the way of arguing. If someone would only speak <em>sense</em> to him. You all know as well as I do how many children we’ve got, and⁠—and⁠—an⁠—other coming,” sobbed the poor lady, “if something doesn’t happen to me, which I am sure is more than likely, and might be expected. I don’t blame dear grandpapa, for he has said everything, and so have I; but I do think his brothers ought to take a little more interest. Oh, Frank, you know it doesn’t matter for you. You are a young man, you can go anywhere; but when there are five children and⁠—and⁠—an⁠—other⁠—And how are we to live? You know what a little bit of money I had when Gerald married me. Everybody knows Gerald never cared for money. If I had had a good fortune it would have been quite different,” cried poor Louisa, with a little flow of tears and a querulous sob, as though that too was Gerald’s fault. “He has not sent off his letter yet, Frank,” said the injured wife; “if you would but speak to him. He does not mind me or grandpapa, but he might mind you. Tell him we shall have nothing to live on; tell him⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Hush,” said Gerald. He came forward to the table, very pale and patient, as became a man at the point of legal death. “I <em>have</em> sent away my letter. By this time I am no longer Rector of Wentworth. Do not break my heart. Do you think there is any particular in the whole matter which I have not considered⁠—the children, yourself, everything? Hush; there is nothing now to be said.”</p>
			<p>The Squire rose, almost as pale as his son, from his chair. “I think I’ll go out into the air a little,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth. “There’s always something new happening. Here is a son of my own,” said the old man, rising into a flush of energy, “who has not only deserted his post, but deserted it secretly, Frank. God bless my soul! don’t speak to me, sir; I tell you he’s gone over to the enemy as much as Charley would have done if he had deserted at the Alma⁠—and done it when nobody knew or was thinking. I used to be thought a man of honour in my day,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth, bitterly; “and it’s a mean thing to say it came by their mother’s side. There’s Jack⁠—”</p>
			<p>The eldest son roused himself up at the mention of his own name. Notwithstanding all his faults, he was not a man to stand behind backs and listen to what was said of him. He came forward with his usual ease, though a close observer might have detected a flush on his face. “I am here, sir,” said the heir. “I cannot flatter myself you will have much pleasure in seeing me; but I suppose I have still a right to be considered one of the family.” The Squire, who had risen to his feet, and was standing leaning against the table when Jack advanced, returned to his chair and sat down as his eldest son confronted him. They had not met for years, and the shock was great. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth put his hand to his cravat and pulled at it with an instinctive movement. The old man was still feeble from his late illness, and apprehensive of a return of the disease of the Wentworths. He restrained himself, however, with force so passionate that Jack did not guess at the meaning of the gasp which, before the Squire was able to speak to him, convulsed his throat, and made Frank start forward to offer assistance which his father impatiently rejected. The Squire made, indeed, a great effort to speak with dignity. He looked from one to another of his tall sons as he propped himself up by the arms of his chair.</p>
			<p>“You are the most important member of the family,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth; “it is long since you have been among us, but that is not our fault. If things had been different, I should have been glad of your advice as a man of the world. Anyhow, I can’t wish you to be estranged from your brothers,” said the Squire. It was all anyone could say. The heir of Wentworth was not to be denounced or insulted among his kindred, but he could not be taken to their bosom. Perhaps the reception thus given him was more galling than any other could have been to Jack Wentworth’s pride. He stood at the table by himself before his father, feeling that there existed no living relations between himself and anyone present. He had keen intellectual perceptions, and could recognise the beauty of honour and worth as well as most people; and the contrast between himself and the others who surrounded him presented itself in a very forcible light to Jack. Instead of Gerald and Frank, Wodehouse was <em>his</em> allotted companion. For that once he was bitter, notwithstanding his habitual good-humour.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” he said; “it would be a pity to estrange me from my brothers. We are, on the whole, a lucky trio. I, whom my relations are civil to; and Frank, who is not acquitted yet, though he seems so confident; and Gerald, who has made the greatest mistake of all⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Jack,” said the Curate, “nobody wants to quarrel with you. You’ve dealt shabbily by me, but I do not mind. Only talk of things you understand⁠—don’t talk of Gerald.”</p>
			<p>For a moment Jack Wentworth was roused almost to passion. “What is Gerald that I should not understand him?” said Jack; “he and I are the original brood. You are all a set of interlopers, the rest of you. What is Gerald that I should not talk of him? In the world, my dear Frank,” continued the heir, superciliously, “as the Squire himself will testify, a man is not generally exempted from criticism because he is a parson. Gerald is⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I am a simple Catholic layman, nothing more,” said Gerald; “not worth criticism, having done nothing. I am aware I am as good as dead. There is no reason why Jack should not talk if it pleases him. It will make no difference to me.”</p>
			<p>“And yet,” said Frank, “it is only the other day that you told us you were nothing if not a priest.”</p>
			<p>Gerald turned upon him with a look of melancholy reproach that went to the Curate’s heart. “It is true I said so,” he replied, and then he made a pause, and the light died out of his pale face. “Don’t bring up the ghosts of my dead battles, Frank. I said so only the other day. But it is the glory of the true Church,” said the convert, with a sudden glow which restored colour for a moment to his face, “to restrain and subdue the last enemy, the will of man. I am content to be nothing, as the saints were. The fight has been hard enough, but I am not ashamed of the victory. When the law of the Church and the obedience of the saints ordain me to be nothing, I consent to it. There is nothing more to say.”</p>
			<p>“And this is how it is to be!” cried Louisa. “He knows what is coming, and he does not care⁠—and none of you will interfere or speak to him! It is not as if he did not know what would happen. He tells you himself that he will be nothing; and even if <em>he</em> can put up with it after being a man of such consideration in the county, how am <em>I</em> to put up with it? We have always been used to the very best society,” said poor Louisa, with tears. “The Duke himself was not more thought of; and now he tells you he is to be nothing!” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Wentworth stopped to dry her eyes with tremulous haste. “<em>He</em> may not mind,” said Louisa, “for at least he is having his own way. It is all very well for a man, who can do as he pleases; but it is his poor wife who will have to suffer. I don’t know who will visit me after it’s all over, and people will give over asking us if we don’t ask them again; and how can we ever have anybody, with five children⁠—or more⁠—and only a few hundreds a-year? Oh, Frank, it kills me to think of it. Don’t you think you might speak to him again?” she whispered, stretching up to his ear, when Gerald, with a sigh, had gone back to his window. The Squire, too, cast an appealing glance at his younger son.</p>
			<p>“It is all true enough that she says,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth. “She mayn’t understand <em>him</em>, Frank, but she’s right enough in what she’s saying. If things were different between your brother and me, I’d ask his advice,” said the Squire, with a sigh. He gave a longing look at his eldest son, who stood with his usual ease before the fireplace. Matters had gone a great deal too far between the father and son to admit of the usual displeasure of an aggrieved parent⁠—all that was over long ago; and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth could not restrain a certain melting of the heart towards his firstborn. “He’s not what I could wish, but he’s a man of the world, and might give us some practical advice,” said the Squire, with his anxious looks. Of what possible advantage advice, practical or otherwise, could have been in the circumstances, it was difficult to see; but the Squire was a man of simple mind, and still believed in the suggestions of wisdom. He still sat in the easy-chair, looking wistfully at Jack, and with a certain faith that matters might even yet be mended, if the counsel of his eldest son, as a man of the world, could be had and could be trusted; when Frank, who had an afternoon service at Wharfside, had to leave the family committee. Gerald, who roused up when his younger brother mentioned the business he was going upon, looked at Frank almost as wistfully as his father looked at Jack. “It may be the last time,” he said to himself; “if you’ll let me, I’ll go with you, Frank;” and so the little conclave was broken up. The people in Prickett’s Lane were greatly impressed by the aspect of Gerald Wentworth, as he went, silent and pale, by his brother’s side, down the crowded pavement. They thought it must be a bishop at least who accompanied the Curate of <abbr>St.</abbr> Roque’s; and the women gathered at a little distance and made their comments, as he stood waiting for his brother after the service. “He don’t look weakly nor sickly no more nor the clergyman,” said one; “but he smiles at the little uns for all the world like my man smiled the night he was took away.” “Smilin’ or not smilin’,” said another, “I don’t see as it makes no matter; but I’d give a deal to know what Elsworthy and them as stands by Elsworthy can say after that.” “Maybe, then, he’d give the poor fatherless children a blessing afore he’d go,” suggested a poor Irish widow, who, having been much under <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wentworth’s hands “in her trouble,” was not quite sure now what faith she professed, or at least which Church she belonged to. Such was the universal sentiment of Prickett’s Lane. Meanwhile Gerald stood silent, and looked with pathetic, speechless eyes at the little crowd. He was no priest now⁠—he was shorn of the profession which had been his life. His hope of being able to resign all things for Christ’s sake had failed him. Too wary and politic to maintain in a critical age and country the old licence of the ages of Faith, even his wife’s consent, could he have obtained it, would not have opened to the convert the way into the priesthood. A greater trial had been required of him; he was nothing, a man whose career was over. He stood idly, in a kind of languor, looking on while the Curate performed the duties of his office⁠—feeling like a man whom sickness had reduced to the last stage of life, and for whom no earthly business remained; while, at the same time, his aspect struck awe, as that of a bishop at the least, to the imagination of Prickett’s Lane.</p>
